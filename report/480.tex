The hilly terrain and the low latitude of Dunedin, New Zealand causes varying amounts of sunlight throughout the city. This project set out to find the distribution of sunlight cast over areas of Dunedin at different times of the year and present this information in a usable manner. An interactive three-dimensional (the viewer) and an accurate shadow and seconds-of-sunlight calculator (the aggregator) were written to let a user explore and witness how shadows change in real-time and accurately calculate the seconds-of-sunlight the city receives.

\chapter{Introduction}
The city of Dunedin is well known for being a dark and cold city because of the hills surrounding the centre of the city that shade large areas in the winter months. This project set out to discover the amount of sunlight Dunedin receives over any given period of the year and present the data in a way that a user could use it to draw conclusions from.\\

\section{Goals}
The goals of this project were to research and implement a sunlight projection model for the city of Dunedin. There are two parts; an interactive three-dimensional display to show point in time distribution of sunlight over Dunedin and a data aggregator to augment the display with computed measures of sunlight coverage over time ranges.

\section{Chapter Outline}
This chapter introduces the project, its goals and gives some background information to the reader. Chapter two focuses on how physical data was gathered from the environment, the methods used to convert them into a representation usable for the project and the accuracy that was obtained in these measurements. Chapter three looks at the interactive three-dimensional viewer built to display the distribution of sunlight over Dunedin in real-time and its implementation using the Java OpenGL wrapper library\cite{JOGL}. Chapter four is about the data aggregator, how it can accurately ray-trace the shadows by sacrificing the ability to run in real-time, the amount of sunlight an area receives, how the data it calculates can be explored and the results generated. Chapter 5 summarises how the project accomplished the tasks it set out to solve, the results of these tasks and remaining tasks that could be worked on.

\section{Background Information}
\subsection{OpenGL and JOGL} 
To create the viewer and allow it to be used in an interactive manner the Java OpenGL (JOGL)\cite{JOGL} libraries are used. JOGL is a wrapper library that exports the OpenGL application programming interface (API) to the Java programming language. OpenGL or Open Graphics Library is a cross platform API for writing applications that use two and three dimensional computer graphics. The project uses version 2.0 of the OpenGL libraries for access to programmable shaders and buffer objects and will be able to run on any graphics hardware that supports OpenGL 2.0. Buffer objects are useful to store and retrieve data from the graphics card with little overhead and programmable shaders are used to directly program the rendering pipeline to calculate large numbers of similar vector and matrix equations using the graphics hardware instead of the central processing unit.


\chapter{Physical Data}
To describe how shadows are cast over Dunedin, physical elevation models and mathematical models of the Sun's position are required. The digital elevation model is used to generate the three-dimensional map of Dunedin and the Sun's position is used to cast shadows over this map at given point in time. In this chapter the digital elevation model of Dunedin and the algorithmic model of the Sun's position will be described and checked for accuracy.

\section{Elevation Data}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{heightmapandwater.png}
\caption{A Height Map exported from the elevation data with areas of water painted in blue}
\label{image:elevation-water}
\end{figure}
The height data for Dunedin was collected from the surveying department of the University of Otago. The data contains a map with a width of 1237 points and a height of 881 points, with the $x,y$ data points separated by 15 metres and covers most of general Dunedin from South Taieri to the top of Pine Hill. The data is encoded as a 1237x881 text file of decimal pointed numbers that represent the height above sea level in metres at that point, where position $0,0$ is south-west of Brighton and $1237,881$ is slightly north of Port Chalmers. There are areas where the data is approximated that lie outside the urban area of Dunedin, such as the hills north-west of Leith Valley and around Cape Saunders therefore these areas are not examined as greatly as the metropolitan Dunedin area.

\subsection{Height Points Below Sea Level}
The definition between what is in water and what is not gets complicated when dealing with areas of reclaimed land like South Dunedin, especially when the tide rises to such a level that it can overflow in to some of these areas and the height data does not not contain a fixed value for the water height, rather the height is allowed to go negative, possibly to map the ocean floor. It was originally assumed that all areas of land that were below zero metres were in the ocean and colouring these blue. Doing this left out large areas of reclaimed land around the harbour area and was highly inaccurate when compared to an image of where the ocean begins.To work around the lack of definition of what is below sea level and what is not, an image was generated (see figure~\ref{image:elevation-water}) with the areas of water coloured a strong blue (RGB 0,0,255). The image is overlayed on the height data map when being used in the viewer with a 1:1 mapping of height points to image pixels to represent the areas of land that fall into the ocean. The areas of the height data that fall in the water are clamped to a height of 0.1 because the shape and depth of the ocean floor is of no use to this project.

\subsection{Accuracy}
In the project proposal the accuracy of the height data was going to be checked using a global positioning system (GPS) . Unfortunately, the accuracy of the GPS height data was far lower than expected and was dropped as a method of calculating the accuracy of the land elevation. A GPS is rated to be accurate to heights of approximately $\pm$ 15 metres 95\% of the time~\cite{gpsaltitude}. These inaccuracies were observed when standing at sea level with a GPS and getting results approximately 10 metres higher than the current position.

The best way to confirm the accuracy of the height data would be to compare it to other geographical data sources. Before going to the surveying department for the height information other sources were tried. The Shuttle Radio Topography Mission (SRTM)\cite{srtm} was a near-global scale project by NASA to generate topographical maps and includes all of New Zealand at a resolution of 30 metres. An old version of ARC GIS was provided by Geoff Wyvill containing topographical information of New Zealand, unfortunately the software used to read the topographical map information was old and could not be run in such a way to export the data. Scraping height data off Google Maps\cite{gmaps} was attempted but the large number of http requests (approximately one million) required to get an accurate height map for Dunedin was impossible because of the limit on http requests Google lets any single person perform.

\subsection{Future Work}
Integrating other height data that includes other cities and geographical regions was left out of the project because the main area of focus was the Dunedin region. Collecting extra data and allowing the viewer and aggregator work on larger data sets would allow for contrasts and comparisons between the sun other areas receive and Dunedin receives and would allow for the project to be utilised for more than one small area.

\section{Sun}
To generate shadows over the representation created of Dunedin the direction vector at a given time has to be calculated accurately using a given time and geographical position. To avoid coming up with the astronomical calculations by hand a software project that already calculates most of the solar position information was translated from the c programming language and integrated into the project.

\subsection{Calculating the Position of the Sun}
To calculate the position of the Sun, the current Julian date, solar declination and hour angle must be determined. The Julian date is calculated by converting the current system time in seconds elapsed since January 1st 1970 to the current Julian Date in days and fractions of days since January 1, 4713 BC. The hour angle is the angle between the plane of the Earth and the plane of the Sun at a given time and is zero when the Sun is directly above the Earth during solar noon. Calculating the hour angle can be done using the current longitude and Julian time\note{the current timezone is not needed}. Solar declination is a measure of how many degrees North or South of the equator the Sun is when viewed from the centre of the earth and can be calculated by the current time. Using these calculations and the current latitude the Sun's current azimuth and elevation can be easily computed.

Code from the open source Redshift project\cite{redshift} was used to calculate the position of the Sun.  Code from other projects were examined, such as the solar positioning libraries for Java\cite{javasunlib}, however the algorithms used in this library, the PSA\cite{psa} and SPA\cite{spa} algorithms, have the unfortunate downside that the algorithms they are based on do not work for areas in the Southern Hemisphere\cite{southsun} and modifying these algorithms to work in the southern hemisphere is outside the scope of the project.

The code modified from the RedShift project to find the current solar elevation are the solar.c and solar.h files, which are based on Javascript code by U.S.\ Department of Commerce, National Oceanic {\&} Atmospheric Administration\cite{usnoaa} and is based on equations from Astronomical Algorithms\cite{astronomicalalgorithms}. Code from the Redshift project is used to calculate the current Julian date, solar declination, hour angle and solar elevation. Calcuating the solar azimuth is not performed by Redshift so other methods of calculating it were explored. After trying many different algorithms, the only azimuth calculator that handled negative latitude and times when the altitude is 90{\degree} was the method described on the University of Southern California's Architecture Site\cite{solarazi} that breaks the azimuth calculation down into the $x$ and $y$ components.

\subsubsection{Time}
Calculating the position of the Sun requires the current time to be known. Java's built in GregorianCalendar class was used to keep track of the current date/time, handle changes in daylight savings time and update the time automatically. The method getSystemTimeMillis() is used to get the current time from the calendar when calculating the position of the Sun because it returns the current UNIX time in milliseconds which can then be passed to the Redshift libraries to calculate the Julian date.

When the Sun goes down ( $\mathit{elevation} < 0$ ) the time class's update method enters a while loop that increments the time until the Sun comes back above the horizon. It does this by jumping forward or backward six hours in time, if time is travelling forwards or backwards, because every night in Dunedin lasts for at least six hours and then incrementing the time in one minute steps and testing the Sun elevation at the new time. Once the Sun elevation is greater than zero the time code breaks out of the loop and returns control back to the program that called it. Taking control of the time once the Sun goes beyond the horizon prevents the program from doing unnecessarily calculations and ensures at every point in time the Sun is shining on some part of the map. Originally code for calculating the sunrise and sunset times was going to be used to calculate the number of hours and minutes the time needed to jump forward or backward to avoid being in complete darkness, however this code was thrown away because the calculations for the Sun rise and set were to inaccurate and difficult to implement compared to naively checking the elevation.\notedme{although presumably the next sunrise time could be determined in a closed form equation, or by some sort of method of descent.}\note{yes it can but the calculation is quite inaccurate}

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Calculated position of the Sun using data scraped from \url{satellite-caculations.com}~\cite{solarpos}}
\label{table:websun}
}
\end{table}

The accuracy of the Sun's position calculations was tested by comparing the results from the algorithms used in the project with results from other Sun position calculators and by setting up a physical experiment to calculate the position of the Sun at the current time. Using the solar position calculator from \url{satellite-caculations.com}\cite{solarpos} the solar altitude and azimuth at 15:19 on October 4th is 321.1353{\degree} and 41.72{\degree}(including atmospheric refraction). Observing table~\ref{table:websun} it can be seen that the results generated by the Sun code in the project accurately resembles that generated by other code, even without taking atmospheric refraction into account and the accuracy obtained is more than enough for calculating shadows.

A rudimentary device seen in figure~\ref{image:sun-contraption} was used to calculate the physical position of the Sun by finding the angle between north, and the shadow cast by the device to find the azimuth and the length of the shadow compared to the length of the device to find the azimuth. The device is made up of a piece of string tied to a weight and is hung from above to ensure that the device is pointing towards the centre of the Earth. The azimuth was recorded using a magnetic compass on a mobile phone and modified to point to true north by applying Dunedin's magnetic declination (the angle between magnetic north and true north) of approximately 24.8\degree east. Data was taken from this device at three different times on the 5th of October from outside the Opheo building.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ | l | X | X | X | X |}
\hline
Time & True Sun Azimuth & Sun Azimuth Calculation & True Sun Elevation & Sun Elevation Calculation\\ \hline
13:08 & 15.8 & 7.027 & 44.09 & 48.4507 \\ \hline
14:47 & 344.8 & 330.967 & 40.376 & 45.1352\\ \hline

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Calculated position of the sun using real data taken on October 5th 2011}
\label{realsun}
\end{table}

From table~\ref{table:realsun} it can be seen that the calculation differences are quite different between the physical position of the Sun and the calculated position of the Sun. The difference is caused almost entirely by the errors in gathering the physical data and physical anomalies such as atmospheric refraction differences in temperature. Firstly, the mobile phone compass used to find the azimuth of the Sun is highly inaccurate giving values that are $\pm$40{\degree} for the same direction. Secondly, the device created to measure the elevation of the Sun had a tendency to oscillate in the wind, and lastly the surface on which the length of the shadow was measured was not perpendicular to the device. All of the elevation calculations are within 5{\degree} and the azimuth calculations are within 20{\degree} which is within the possible margin or error caused by these effects. Compensation for these errors is outside the scope of this project and thus it is safe to assume that the calculations performed to find the Sun's position are accurate enough for the shadow calculations.

\chapter{Three-Dimensional Simulation of Real-Time Shadow Information}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{viewer.png}
\caption{A screenshot of the viewer looking down at Dunedin}
\label{image:viewer}
\end{figure}

The viewer is an interactive three-dimensional simulator of the Sun as it travels through the sky over the city of Dunedin. It allows the user to view shadows cast by the Sun over the varying landscape in real-time. It exposes the ability to run in two different modes; shadow-mapping mode, where OpenGL shadow maps are used to generate shadows, and aggregator shadowing mode, where the shadow data from the aggregator is used to calculate shadows. Runnning the viewer in OpenGL shadowing mode allows the viewer to be used in real-time with less accurate shadows then those generated by the aggregator shadows. The user can control the position of the camera in the viewer, the current time and many other variables to see the simulated city from any perspective and time that the Sun is above the horizon.

\section{Drawing the Scene}

\subsection{Elevation Data}
Geographical height data is drawn by the viewer using OpenGL. After the height data has been decoded and stored in an internal data structure OpenGL buffer objects are created to store the vertex position, colour, texture coordinates and vector normals. Buffer objects allow sending the data to be drawn directly to the graphics card's local memory where it can be redrawn and updated quickly without resending the information. Due to the large number of vertices present in the height data and the static nature of the data, using buffers to store the vertex data significantly lowers the number of draw calls to the graphics hardware in comparison to using the fixed function pipeline and decreases the amount of time between frames in the viewer. Once the vertex data has been passed to the graphics memory it is drawn onto the screen by passing it through a set of GLSL shaders to calculate the vertices final position, by multiplying it by the current projection (for perspective) and modelview (for scaling and rotation) matrix, and colour by multiplying it against the ambient,diffuse,specular and shadow calculations. 


\section{Textual Information}
In figure~\ref{image:viewer} there is a box in the top right hand corner that shows the current time, solar azimuth and solar elevation. Drawing this information is useful because the user can tell what the current time being represented is without leaving the viewer and more information can be easily exposed .Drawing this data is done using the built in JOGL TextRenderer class and is rendered over top of all other frames using a two-dimensional orthographic projection matrix .

\subsection{Overlay Data}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{suburbs.jpg}
\caption{Map overlay presented over the elevation data}
\label{image:overlay}
\end{figure}
A map overlay in figure~\ref{image:overlay} is drawn on top of the scene to show major roads, points of interest and terrain information. This gives the user an extra reference point to find specific areas that they may be interested in examining. The map was taken from Google Maps\cite{gmaps} \note{if you look very closely there are noticeable copyright watermarks on the overlay data, I didn't think they needed to be obvious and I haven't modified the image to remove them so I'm sure it's fine} and scaled to be the exact width and height of the height data. The overlay information is drawn into the scene by setting the vertex's material colour to be the colour of the overlay map at the vertex's $x,y$ position.

\section{Shadows, Lighting and Textures}
Shadows, lighting and textures are drawn onto the scene using vertex and pixel shaders. Diffuse and specular lighting are performed by calculating the dot product of the vertex normals with the direction vector to the Sun. Shadow lighting is implemented by using shadow mapping to test whether a given pixel can be seen by a light source. Textures are drawn in the fragment shader using the built in GLSL sampler2d data structure to store the pixel data and texture2D function to get the colour at a given vertex from the texture.\note{lowered density slightly}

\subsection{Shadow Maps}
Shadow mapping is a method of quickly generating shadow information from a three-dimensional view which sacrifices accuracy for speed and ease of implementation. Shadow mapping works by storing the depth values of a scene from a lights point-of-view into an off-screen frame buffer and testing the depth component of each pixel in the scene against the stored depth value at that point. If the depth buffers from the pixel are not present in the frame buffer than the point is said to be in shadow and is dimmed. In implementing shadowing mapping , OpenGL and GLSL shader code code was copied from Fabian Sanglard's website\cite{shadowb} and modified from C++ and GLUT to work using Java and JOGL.

\subsubsection{Rendering the Scene From the Sun's Position}
The position of the Sun is drawn onto the scene for reference purposes as a OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) sphere and is calculated by fixing the distance from the scene to the Sun to be 15 kilometres. From this position the scene is rendered into the off screen frame buffer using an orthographic projection matrix. If the sun is placed far away from the scene the resolution of the shadow map suffers because the frame buffer contains areas that are outside of the scene, therefore not being utilised. Using an orthographic projection matrix allows the scene to be drawn close to the scene while still lighting all points that would be seen if the sun was infinitely far away from the scene.

\subsubsection{Shadow Map Accuracy}
The accuracy of a shadow map is limited by the resolution of the off-screen buffer and the accuracy of the depth buffer. The resolution of the shadow map used in the viewer is 8 times that of the scene and so is reasonably accurate at the expense of some speed. By making the resolution of the shadow map larger the artefacts generated around the edge of objects is reduced, for example when the Sun is low on the horizon increasing the resolution of the shadow map reduces the amount of jagged edges at the intersection between areas in shadow and areas not in shadow. Increasing the precision of the depth buffer reduces self shadowing, which can be seen occurring around the tops of hills in figure~\ref{image:aggregatorvsshadowmapping}. A small hack is used in the shadow mapping code to decrease the amount of self shadowing by increasing the height of the depth buffer by a small (0.005) value, unfortunately it does not remove it entirely and increasing the precision of the depth buffer would requires less vertices to be drawn onto the scene or suffering a large performance penalty.

\section{Visual Comparison Between the Viewer and Dunedin}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{realvsviewer.jpg}
\caption{A camera image taken from signal hill at 16:45 on September 28th 2011 and the same image generated in the viewer}
\label{image:realvsviewer}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{image:realvsviewer} the scene generated by the viewer from the top of signal hill is very similar to that of an actual image. All of the major geographical features of Dunedin can be made out and similar shadows are present in both images. Not seen in the photograph is the position of the Sun, which was in approximately the same position in both scenes. In both scenes shadows can be seem forming around the town belt area and on the hills near St. Clair beach.\note{Darkness is a problem in the viewer when the sun starts to set and the diffuse colour of everything begins to drop. Here is my attempted fix}

\section{Usage}

To run the viewer firstly the JOGL libraries must be installed and set up to work with the installed Java runtime library. Running the OpenGL code requires a graphics card that fully supports OpenGL version 2. See the controls below for an idea of how to run it. Command line parameters are not given.

\subsection{Control}

Mouse drags can be used to rotate the camera up, down, left and right. For example if the user wishes to look to the right they would click and drag the mouse right and the camera will move once they let go of the mouse.

\section{Future Work and Extensions}
Instrumenting the viewer to run a loop based on a script passed into the viewer was something that was always on the agenda to implement if there was enough time. This would have allowed the program to give a quick demonstration of how it can be used and what values can be gathered without looking through the documentation. Profiling and testing of the viewer could also be done repeatedly and accurately by running the code through the script and throwing out differences and errors between different versions of the software.

\chapter{Data Aggregator for Accurate Shadow Calculation and Data Accumulation}
The aggregator calculates shadows shadows using a version of ray tracing a light ray from the starting point to the Sun. It does this on a per vertex basis to ensure each vertex is calculated accurately, unlike OpenGL methods such as shadow mapping which may use the same shadow calculation on multiple vertices, causing artefacts to appear around edge cases. It can be run as a standalone program where it outputs Targa format(TGA) image files and comma separated value(CSV) files for the number of sunlight seconds received over a period of time or as part of the viewer where it can be used to expose its accurate shadow calculations.

\section{Cleary's Algorithm for Calculating Shadows}
To calculate whether a given point is in shadow or not a modified version of Cleary's algorithm is used, see algorithm~\ref{alg:shadow-calculation} for a full description. Cleary's algorithm was originally used for fast spacial subdivision however it works equally well in raytracing a light ray from a point through a two-dimensional grid of points like the one present in the elevation data. For each point the light ray travels from the source to the Sun through each grid square it meets until it reaches the end of the grid. At each grid line intersection the height at that point is compared to the height of the Sun along the direction vector between the starting point and the Sun, if the direction vector's $y$ value multiplied by the current length along the vector is less than the height at that point then it is said to be in shadow, otherwise it continues on the direction vector until the end of the grid is reached or another point causes it to be seen to be in shadow.

\section{Integration Into the Viewer}
The aggragator output can be run in the viewer if the `use aggregator' and `generate aggregator texture' switches are turned on. The aggregator works in the viewer by generating a texture out of the current shadow information that is white for not in shadow and black for not in shadow. By placing the texture over the map of Dunedin aggregator shadows can be observed on the terrain. Because the aggregator code uses different shader code to the viewer, the overlay images and shading are not drawn on the scene.

\section{Picking the Areas to Scan}
The aggregator uses the overlay image seen in figure~\ref{image:elevation-water} to select which points to scan. Any area that is coloured a strong blue is counted as in water and any area that is a solid black colour is thought of being outside the desired range to scan and can be left out of the aggregator calculations. This allows the user to specify specific areas of Dunedin that they wish to ignore, by painting them black. The aggregator can be run faster through this method because the points do not need to be checked for shadows, giving a linear speed increase in the number of points ignored. Data output from ignored areas is presented as a black square when outputting to a Targa file or as a value with no contents in a CSV file.

\section{Optimisations}
The aggregator runs fastest when there are a large number of shadows cast over the city, allowing it to break out of the scan towards the Sun early. When there are few shadows being cast the runtime of the aggregator slows down by a large factor because it has to scan to the edge of the map for every point to find if it is in shadow. During noon when most of the scene is in sunlight the aggregator runs at its slowest.

By subdividing the map into small areas and checking for shadows around the edge of each area the aggregator can run faster when there are large sections of the scene that receive direct sunlight. If there is no shadow present around any of the edges and the area is reasonably flat (no more than five metres of variation around the edges) then it is safe to assume that all of the points within that region will not be in shadow. The aggregator uses a square area of 10 points which it scans around the outside edge of for shadows, if no shadow is found then all of the points within the square are set to be not in shadow.

\subsection{Speed Increase}
To test the effect of the optimisations the data aggregator was run 1000 times on the whole of Dunedin (ignoring only water) between the times of 08:00:00 and 17:59:24 on October 1st 2011, with the average time in milliseconds it took to run the aggregator recorded at each time. On a 1.9GHz AMD Dual Core Turion processor the optimised code took an average of 6800.486 milliseconds and the unoptimised code took 15977.598 milliseconds to calculate all of the shadows at a given time. Using a 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 920 processor the optimised code took an average of 1147.176 milliseconds and the unoptimised code took 2551.007 milliseconds to calculate the shadows. Using the optimised code increased the speed by a factor of 2.35x on the 1.9GHz processor and 2.19x on the 2.66GHz processor.

\subsection{Other Methods}
The code does not necessarily need to be linearly optimised to speed it up. With multi-core processors becoming more common on computers, multi-threading the aggregator code to take advantage of more than one processor at a time would give significant performance increases. Calculating the shadows for each point does not depend of the state of any other point at a static time and can be easily threadable by subdividing the data into work units, queuing the work units to be processed and waiting for each unit to finish.

\section{Comparison to OpenGL Shadow Mapping}

\label{image:aggregatorvsshadowmapping}
\end{figure}

Shadow maps are noticeably less accurate at calculating shadows then the shadow-tracing methods the aggregator uses. In the side-by-side comparison in figure~\ref{image:aggregatorvsshadowmapping} it can be seen that shadows generated by shadow mapping have noticeable aliasing and calculation errors. Aliasing around the edges of shadows occurs in the shadow map when the angle between the Sun and the map of Dunedin approaches 180{\degree} and the shadows begin to grow long. Self-shadowing is also a problem with shadow mapping and can only be fixed by increasing the accuracy of the depth buffer (which slows down shadow calculations). Neither of these problems arise in the data aggregator because of the accuracy gained by shadow-tracing the area between the shadow and the Sun and checking for intersections. The aggregator pays for this accuracy by running slower than real-time (approximately 7 seconds between calculations for an older 1.9GHz machine and 2.5 on a newer 2.66GHz machine) compared to the shadow maps which run at $>$30 calculations/second with a dedicated graphics processor.

\note{why would frame skipping be performed? The time is updated every frame not the other way round, by real-time I mean the program updates more than 24 times per second}
\section{Output}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Total sunlight received on October 1st 2011 between 08:00 and 19:00}
\label{image:aggregator-targa-output}
\end{figure}

When the aggregator is run as a standalone program a Targa image file and/or a comma separated value (CSV) file can be output from the program. When run over a period of time the program will output a CSV file with the seconds-of-sunlight received for every point and a Targa image with the points that received the highest seconds-of-sunlight in white, points that received little sunlight in a shade of grey and points that received no sunlight in black.

\subsection{Interpretation of the Seconds-of-Sunlight Data}

\end{figure}
%\subsubsection{Errors}
%There are small errors in the calculation of what points receive no Sun. For example the completely in shadow line %going from the middle top of figure~\ref{image:aggregator-targa-output}. These are not errors in the aggregator %rather approximations and inaccuracies in the elevation data and in other tests these areas would have been ignored.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Known Areas that Get Low Levels of Sunlight}
Certain areas of Dunedin such as Leith Valley, the town belt and the west side of north-east valley are well known for receiving the lowest levels of sunlight in Dunedin. Comparing figures~\ref{image:aggregator-targa-output} and \ref{image:wintersolstice} to common knowledge about the amount of Sun different parts of Dunedin receive it can be seen that areas like Leith Valley do receive some of the lowest levels of sunlight.

\section{Future work}
%further optimisation
With more time it would more complicated optimisations could have been explored. For example, shadow backtracking
finds points in shadow and assumes that nearby points in the direction of the sun that are lower than or equal in height to the current point will be in shadow. Common points that cause shadows such as the ridge line of a hill can also be stored and intersections with these points checked before na\"{\i}vely checking for intersections with every point. Threading the code would have provided a good speed increase if the computer it is running on has two or more central processing units.


\chapter{Conclusion}
The project managed to accomplish more than what it set out to achieve by creating the interactive three-dimensional display that shows real-time distribution of sunlight over the city of Dunedin and a data aggregator that can augment the display with computed measures of sunlight coverage over time ranges and output them to files. Slight modifications were made to the original project proposal, such as using a global positioning system to check the accuracy of the height information was not used, the viewer ended up being a real-time application instead of showing point in time distributions it can show real-time distributions of sunlight and the aggregator can not only display computed measures of sunlight over time ranges it can also be run as a more accurate alternative to the OpenGL shadowing code.

\section{Physical Data}
Geographical information about the city of Dunedin was collected from multiple sources. The height data came from the surveying department, a map overlay was created using a Google Maps\cite{gmaps} image and the position of the water was generated by hand from the map overlay. While it was difficult to prove the accuracy of the data without the correct tools or sources, comparing real-world images with the physical data showed a relatively close mapping between the geographic data and the real world to  gathered a close enough approximation was gathered to make conclusions. 

The Sun's position at a given point in time required a lot of trial and error before a suitable calculation was found that generated sensible results. Code from the Redshift project\cite{redshift} was used to calculate the solar elevation and calculations from The University of Southern California Department of Architecture\cite{solarazi} were used in conjunction with the calculations performed by the Redshift code to find the solar azimuth. Through testing on other sources of that present the Sun's position and real world data the accuracy of the Sun's position was proven.

The most useful extension to this project would be to allow it to work on data sets outside of the the city of Dunedin. With the code already there to calculate the Sun's position all it would take is a way of gathering more elevation data and the project could be expanded to calculate the Sun interaction with a far greater area, or as a way of comparing and contrasting the sunlight cities receive. 

\section{Viewer}
The viewer grew from a simple tool that was designed to show point in time calculations of the distribution of shadows over the city of Dunedin into a fully fledged OpenGL program that can render shadows in real-time, allow the user to position the camera anywhere in the scene, view output from the aggregator and modify the rate at which the sun moves (through changing the time). Using OpenGL vertex buffers to quickly transfer the vertex data to the  graphics processing unit and GLSL shaders to render user-programmable lighting effects such as shadow mapping the viewer is able to quickly render the scene.

\section{Aggregator}
Calculating the total amount of sunlight an area receives is the aggregators job. Using a modified version of Cleary's algorithm to calculate intersections along a grid of data it was possible to calculate if a point was in shadow by tracing the ray through the grid and checking if the point on the grid was higher than the position of the Sun, if so then it was in shadow, if not the continue until the end of the grid is reached. Shadows generated by the aggregators shadow-tracing algorithm were noticeably more accurate than those generated using OpenGL shadow mapping, for example in figure~\ref{image:aggregatorvsshadowmapping} the shadow mapping code is full of artifacts and self shadowing while the aggregator exhibits none of these traits.

 Optimising the shadow-tracing calculation by subdividing the scene and checking for shadows around the edges before dropping to na\"{\i}ve scan of the area if a shadow is found or assuming the area is not going to be in shadow if not shadow is found around the edge decreased the average amount of time the aggregator took to run by two times.

Data generated by the aggregator confirmed the theory that certain parts of Dunedin receive far less sunlight than others. Figure~\ref{image:wintersolstice} shows the amount of sunlight Dunedin received on the day of the winter solstice and it can be seen that the areas that received the largest amount of sunlight were on north facing hills such as the peninsula and the south facing hills around Ravensbourne received little to no sun. The next sunniest areas were Mosgiel and South Dunedin which are not surrounded by any nearby hills.
